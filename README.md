### Hi there, I'm Yago Marinho ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Fullstack Developer with over 6 years of experience, certified by Rocketseat and trained in UX/UI Design at Ironhack. I currently work with React, designing and developing products that prioritize user experience while integrating technologies such as ReactJS, NextJS, NodeJS, and TypeScript.

My focus is on creating solutions that blend technical excellence with user-centered design. Iâ€™m skilled in Design Thinking, usability testing, user stories, and design systems â€” bringing a complete approach to software development and design.
